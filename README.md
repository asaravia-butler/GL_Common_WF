# GeneLab Common Workflow Information and Usage Instructions

## General Workflow Info

### Implementation Tools

The current GeneLab data processing pipelines utilize similar open source tools and processing steps. The steps common to all GeneLab pipelines have been wrapped in the GeneLab (GL) Common Workflow (WF) and the GL Common WF is implemented as a [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow and utilizes [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/) containers or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments to install/run all tools. This workflow is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system.  While knowledge of creating workflows in nextflow is not required to run the workflow as is, [the Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow.
